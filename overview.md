# 2.md - Overview of Projects Presented

## The Three Projects I'll Walk Through

  **SheetRocks - Web-based Spreadsheet Application (2021-2023)**
    - Most complex project, biggest impact
    - React/TS frontend, Go backend, MongoDB/Redis, AWS
    - Key challenges: Backend/Frontend performance, aquiring users
    - Features I owned: Formula range selection, cross-sheet references, macros/automations, sorting algorithms & more

  **FindServers.net - Counter-Strike Server Browser (2024)**
    - Personal passion project, currently live at findservers.net
    - Go backend, React frontend, Redis caching
    - Key challenges: Interfacing with underdocumented API, frontend performance, server data accuracy

  **LanguageLabs - AI Research Venture (2023-2024)**
    - Self-funded startup exploring agentic AI systems
    - Research focus: Meta-learning, self-modifying agents, novel intelligence architectures: can something simpler be abstracted from neural nets?
    - Key challenges: Prompt engineering, exploration into theoretical concepts of AI/intelligence, runway & admin

## What These Projects Demonstrate

  **Technical breadth:**
    - In-depth React experience
    - Can quickly ramp up on new languages, frameworks & codebases
    - Experience beyond typical dev work

  **Startup mindset:**
    - End-to-end ownership
    - Balancing technical debt vs. shipping
    - Understanding business impact of technical decisions
    - Always thinking from the user's perspective
