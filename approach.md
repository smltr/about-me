## How I Approach Technical Problems

  **Action or Analysis?:**
  - Learned to shift between states of thinking and doing
  - Focus on getting into iterative cycles of development -> feedback
  - Both rapid prototyping and thoughtful planning
  - Use my experience and intuition to plan, but also let the problem describe itself while building
  - Low tech debt vs. shipping

  **End-to-End Thinking:**
  - Always think like a user
  - Technical decisions impact business outcomes
  - Integrate non-technical aspects into decision making

  **Pragmatic Engineering:**
  - Choose simple solutions when they work
  - Not every problem needs complex tooling
  - Focus on core functionality and skeletons first
  - Everything is a tradeoff

  **Continuous Learning:**
  - Comfortable working with incomplete information
  - Quick to ramp up on new technologies and codebases
  - Learn by both building and reading
  - Endlessly curious

  **Mindfulness:**
  - Keep tabs on my mental and physical health
  - Move myself, get enough of good enough food, limit what's bad for me
  - Notice myself while I work
    - What am I focused on?
    - What assumptions do I have right now?
    - What tools am I using?
    - What do I not know?
  - Exercise focus as a muscle
    - Time away from distractions, reading, practicing

That's it, thanks!
