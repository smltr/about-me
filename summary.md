# Summary - Problem-Solving Approach & Wrap-Up

## How I Approach Technical Problems

  **Action or Analysis?:**
    - Learned to shift between states of thinking and doing
    - Focus on getting into iterative cycles of development -> feedback
    - Both rapid prototyping and thoughtful planning
    - Use my experience and intuition to plan, but also let the problem describe itself while building
    - Low tech debt vs. shipping

  **End-to-End Thinking:**
    - Always think like a user
    - Technical decisions impact business outcomes
    - Integrate non-technical aspects into decision making

  **Pragmatic Engineering:**
    - Choose simple solutions when they work
    - Not every problem needs complex tooling
    - Focus on core functionality and skeletons first
    - Everything is a tradeoff

  **Continuous Learning:**
    - Comfortable working with incomplete information
    - Quick to ramp up on new technologies and codebases
    - Learn by both building and reading
    - Endlessly curious

  **Mindfulness:**
    - Keep tabs on my mental and physical health
    - Move myself, get enough of good enough food, limit what's bad for me
    - Notice myself while I work
      - What am I focused on?
      - What assumptions do I have right now?
      - What tools am I using?
      - What do I not know?
    - Exercise focus as a muscle
      - Time away from distractions, reading, practicing

## What I'm Looking For

  **Technical Growth:**
    - Complex systems with real-world impact
    - Working on problems I haven't encountered before
    - Collaboration with others, both technical and non-technical

  **Team Environment:**
    - Small, nimble team where individual contributions matter
    - Autonomy balanced with mentorship
    - Startup/inventor culture

  **Problem Space:**
    - Meaningful impact on real industries
    - Challenging technical problems

## What Excites Me About Opportunities

  **Technical Challenges:**
  - Complex systems that push my skills forward
  - Opportunity to work with cutting-edge technology
  - Problems that require both depth and breadth of knowledge

  **Growth Environment:**
  - Learning from experienced teams while contributing my perspective
  - Bridging my research background with production systems
  - Building things that have real-world impact

  **Cultural Fit:**
  - Entrepreneurial environments where individual contributions matter
  - Teams that value pragmatic engineering and shipping
  - Companies solving meaningful problems

## What I Bring & What I'm Seeking

  **What I Bring:**
  - Deep technical experience from startup environments
  - Research mindset combined with pragmatic engineering
  - Full-stack capabilities with AI/ML interests
  - End-to-end product thinking
  - Proven ability to own features from concept to deployment

  **What I seek:**
  - To work on challenging, impactful problems
  - Collaborative environments
  - Opportunities in emerging tech
  - Culture that values both innovation and execution

That's it, thanks!
